# diagrams-haddock

`diagrams-haddock` is a preprocessor which allows embedding images in
Haddock documentation generated using the
[diagrams framework](http://projects.haskell.org/diagrams/).  The code
to generate images is embedded directly within the source file itself
(and the code can be included in the Haddock output or not, as you
wish).  `diagrams-haddock` takes care of generating the images and
linking them into the Haddock output.

## Installing

Just `cabal install diagrams-haddock`.  If you have any trouble, ask
in the `#diagrams` freenode IRC channel, or file a ticket on the
[bug tracker](http://github.com/diagrams/diagrams-haddock/issues).
